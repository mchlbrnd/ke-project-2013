# KE Project 2013

## Introduction

### Context

This project was created during the Knowledge Engineering class of 2013, at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam.

### Authors

The team is composed of three students:
*	Michael Wolbert
*	Alex Olieman
*	Julien Lehuen

### The project

The goal of this KE system is to alter existing recipes to make them suitable for patients with a glycemic conditions (diabetics or hyperglycemeic). It was written using [Python](http://www.python.org/ "Webiste of the Python progrmaming language") and [Pyke](http://pyke.sourceforge.net/ "Website of the Pyke knowledge engine").

## Run

### Requirements

This project needs Python and the corresponding version of Pyke to run properly.

If Python is not yet installed on your system, and is not available in your usual packages manager, you can find the last binaries on Python's [download page](http://www.python.org/download/ "Download Python").

To install Pyke, simply follow the [installation procedure](http://pyke.sourceforge.net/about_pyke/installing_pyke.html "Installing Pyke"), available directly on the webiste of Pyke.

### Run the demo

First, you need to compile the knowledge engine. To do so, run the command `python engine.py`.

Second, you can run the demo by simply running `python run.py`
